# React Article

Implement an `Article` component that accepts the following props:
- `title` — should be displayed inside the `h1` tag;
- `date` — should be displayed inside the `span` tag;
- `text` — should be displayed inside the `p` tag.

The `App` renders the `Article` and passes the data from the `article` object.

## Instructions

- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).
- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://vitmixG.github.io/react_article/) and add it to the PR description.
